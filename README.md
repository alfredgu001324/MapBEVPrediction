## Getting Started
- [Environment Setup](docs/env.md)
- [Prepare Dataset](docs/prepare_dataset.md)
- [Mapping Train and Eval](docs/map.md)
- [Merge Map and Trajectory Dataset](docs/adaptor.md)
- [Trajectory Train and Eval](docs/trj.md)
- [Visualization](docs/visualization.md)

## Results

Mapping checkpoints are [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZhCv4Z_yI7PLirHLS64luE1fV2EPG0sB?usp=sharing). Trajectory prediction checkpoints are [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e0xRQqlIhYaAz3ErfNhZ57FCGN97vyzt?usp=sharing). 

## Dataset

I have uploaded all datasets (complete) for `MapTR`, `StreamMapNet`, `MapTRv2` and `MapTRv2 CL`. They are around 500GB each (StreamMapNet is around 200GB). You can download them through AWS S3. They are located at 
- AWS Bucket Name: **s3://mapbevprediction**
- Region: us-east-2

I will try to transfer them to Hugging Face in the future. AWS is a bit expensive.

Dataset Structure is as follows:
```
